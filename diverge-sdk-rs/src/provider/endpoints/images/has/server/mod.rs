//! The server side of an image has: what a provider sends.
//!
//! [`response`] is the whole of it. A provider answers and is done; it
//! opens no channels of its own for a question this small, so there is
//! no `request` here the way there is on the agentic loop's server
//! side.
//!
//! # And a way to answer it
//!
//! The provider crate's `handle` performs the exchange rather than
//! describing it: hand it the
//! [`ScopeHandle`](crate::wire::server::scope_handle::ScopeHandle) a
//! [`Session`](crate::wire::server::session::Session) yielded, whose
//! caller it is, and the provider's image manager, and it answers. It
//! is the mirror of [`execute`](super::client::execute) on the other
//! side.
