//! The caller half, behind the `client` feature.
//!
//! The mirror of [`server`](crate::server), and off for the same
//! reason: a provider should not have to compile a caller to answer a
//! frame.
//!
//! # What a caller supplies
//!
//! A handler, for the channels the far end opens: serving an image,
//! running a command, proxying Postgres. A caller is not only a source
//! of requests, so it is not only a client in the ordinary sense.
//!
//! # What is here
//!
//! [`router`], the read loop: frames off the socket, forwarded to
//! whoever is waiting. Nothing else yet.
//!
//! The socket itself is not here.
//! [`Connection`](crate::connection::Connection) carries either kind
//! under either half, because which end dialled is not a fact about
//! the protocol.
