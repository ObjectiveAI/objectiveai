/// A running container, as far as this crate needs one.
///
/// What a
/// [`ContainerDeployer`](super::container_deployer::ContainerDeployer)
/// hands back. The type itself is the provider's — a process handle, a
/// name, an instance id, a struct with all three — and this is the part
/// of it this crate has to be able to reach.
///
/// # What belongs here
///
/// Whatever needs something only the thing that deployed the container
/// has. Not "what a provider cannot do from outside", which was the
/// first answer and is too narrow — plenty of what a provider does to a
/// container is done from outside it, and still needs a fact the deploy
/// was the only thing to learn.
///
/// So the three are three facts a provider keeps to itself. Where the
/// container's filesystem is, for [`read`](Self::read) and
/// [`write`](Self::write). How to end it, for [`stop`](Self::stop).
///
/// A filetree will join them when it is written, since watching a
/// filesystem is knowing where one is. A transfer will not — it is a
/// read on one container and a write on another, both already here.
///
/// # Reaching a port is not here, for now
///
/// It was: a `connect` handed back a byte pipe, and everything spoken
/// into a container rode one. It is gone while the shape of that is
/// reconsidered, and it will come back as something — a container that
/// cannot be spoken to serves nobody.
///
/// What it leaves behind is the reason it was ever a method rather than
/// an address: a container's port has a host-side address only on some
/// runtimes, and on the rest the way in is the provider's own control
/// plane. Whatever replaces it inherits that constraint.
///
/// # `Send` and `Sync`
///
/// Because a scope is served by more than one task — a dispatcher
/// reading channel requests, a pump answering one — and a container is
/// reached from any of them, behind a shared reference.
///
/// Which is also why every method takes `&self`. Nothing here consumes
/// a container, including [`stop`](Self::stop): it is stopped while
/// whatever is holding it still holds it, and dropping it afterwards is
/// a separate act that this crate does not define.

    /// this crate names neither.

    /// that told them apart would be doing it for its own benefit
    /// rather than this crate's. Nothing here branches on which
    /// operation failed; what it does with one is put it on the wire.

    ///
    /// Two things would have gone in a [`Result`] and neither belongs

    ///
    /// A container that is ALREADY GONE is not a failure. It exited on
    /// its own, or crashed, or something else stopped it — and what was
    /// asked for is the state rather than the act, so a container that
    /// is not running is the whole of it. An error there would be one
    /// every caller has to recognise and then ignore, which is writing
    /// the same rule in every caller instead of once here.
    ///
    /// A container that WILL NOT stop is a failure, and there is
    /// nothing to do about it. No frame means "the container would not
    /// stop": a scope ends when its provider finishes it, and it
    /// finishes either way. The error would have nowhere to go and no
    /// caller able to act on it.

    /// What an implementation does about the second is its own business
    /// — retry it, log it, leave it for whatever reaps stragglers. That
    /// is operational, and this protocol has no opinion.

    /// is concerned, that container is done.

/// # The two origins
///
/// A caller's write sends its content over the wire, as responses on a
/// channel the provider opened. When that stops early the frame says so
/// with a [`shared::error::Error`](crate::shared::error::Error) — one
/// JSON value, from somebody else's process, meaning whatever that
/// caller meant. That is [`Wire`](Self::Wire).
///
/// A [`transfer`](crate::shared::container::transfer) has no wire in
/// it. Both containers are the provider's, so the bytes go from a
/// [`read`](Container::read) on one straight into a
/// write on the other without ever becoming frames — which is the whole
/// point of having a transfer rather than a read piped through a
/// caller. A read fails with the provider's own error, and that is
/// [`Container`](Self::Container).
///
/// # Why not flatten them
///
/// Making everything a
/// [`shared::error::Error`](crate::shared::error::Error) would mean a
/// provider converting its own read failure into opaque JSON so it
/// could hand it to its own write, in the same process, for nobody's
/// benefit. That is the mistake
/// [`ContainerDeployer::Error`](super::container_deployer::ContainerDeployer::Error)
/// exists to avoid: the type that knows most about what happened, lost
/// at the one moment it is in hand.
///
/// Making everything the provider's own error is not available. A
/// caller's failure is a JSON value from another process, and nothing
/// turns one of those into a runtime's error type.

/// So neither collapses into the other, and the type says so.

///
/// [`Container::write`] uses it as
/// `ContentError<Self::Error>`, but nothing here names that. It is a
